# Amorin-WebProject-JS-React-Components
This repository contains solutions and practice exercises for JavaScript fundamentals (variables, functions, arrays, objects, DOM manipulation, event handling) and the creation of three functional React/NextJS components: WelcomeCard, Counter, and StudentInfo Form. Includes basic styling and comprehensive README.md documentation.

# Time Keeper Pro

Time Keeper Pro is a dual-function web application that combines a stopwatch and timer in one interface. It allows users to precisely track time for various activities with an intuitive and visually appealing design.

## Features

### Stopwatch
- Tracks time with hours, minutes, seconds, and centiseconds
- Start, stop, and reset functionality
- Lap recording system
- Clear all laps button
- Smooth time display updates

### Timer
- Set custom time with hours, minutes, and seconds
- Start, stop, and reset controls
- Real-time countdown display
- Input validation for time values

## Technical Implementation

### HTML Structure
- Clean semantic HTML with separate sections for:
  - Application header with title and reset button
  - Mode selection (stopwatch/timer)
  - Stopwatch display and controls
  - Timer display and controls
  - Lap recording section

### CSS Design
- Modern gradient background with animation
- Responsive layout that works on all device sizes
- Intuitive control buttons with hover effects
- Clear visual distinction between active/inactive modes
- Custom styling for time displays and input fields
- Animated lap entries

### JavaScript Functionality
- Stopwatch:
  - Accurate time tracking using Date objects
  - Lap recording and display
  - Formatting for hours, minutes, seconds, and centiseconds
- Timer:
  - Countdown functionality with setInterval
  - Input validation for time values
  - Time conversion between hours/minutes/seconds
- Mode switching between stopwatch and timer
- Global reset functionality

## Usage
1. Open the HTML file in any modern web browser
2. Select between Stopwatch and Timer modes
3. For Stopwatch:
   - Click "Start" to begin timing
   - Click "Stop" to pause
   - Click "Reset" to reset to zero
4. For Timer:
   - Set the desired time using the input fields
   - Click "Start" to begin countdown
   - Click "Stop" to pause
   - Click "Reset" to clear all inputs
5. Use the top-right "Reset" button to reset the current mode

## Design Notes

- Ensured responsive design for all screen sizes
- Followed the design specifications from the provided image


In Part A which is my practice coding
# My First Interactive Web Page

This little project is a practice ground for the basics of web development. It uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a simple page that you can interact with.

## What's Inside This Project?

You'll find three main files here:

1.  **`Amorinprac.html`**: This is the main structure of the web page. It's like the blueprint that lays out all the content you see, such as headings, paragraphs, buttons, and places for text input.

2.  **`Amorinprac.css`**: This file handles the look and feel of the web page. It tells the browser what colors to use, how big the text should be, how much space there should be between things, and other styling details.

3.  **`Amorinprac.js`**: This is where the magic happens! This file contains all the JavaScript code that makes the page interactive. It allows the page to respond when you click things or type, and it can even change the content and style of the page dynamically.

## What Does This Project Show?

This project was built to demonstrate some fundamental concepts in JavaScript and how it works with HTML and CSS:

* **Handling Data:** It shows how to store information using **variables** (for single pieces of data), **arrays** (for lists of items), and **objects** (for structured information like a profile). It also uses **functions** to perform specific tasks with this data.
* **Changing the Page:** You'll see how JavaScript can **manipulate the webpage's content and appearance** after it's loaded. This includes changing text, altering colors and sizes, and even adding new elements to the page.
* **Responding to You:** The page uses **event handling** to react to user actions. This means when you click a button or type into a text box, the JavaScript code listens for these "events" and then does something in response.

## How to See It In Action

It's very easy to view this project:

1.  Make sure all three files (`Amorinprac.html`, `Amorinprac.css`, `Amorinprac.js`) are saved in the same folder on your computer.
2.  Simply open the `Amorinprac.html` file using any web browser (like Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.). Just double-click the HTML file!

Feel free to open the `.js` file in a text editor to see the JavaScript code and understand how it makes the page interactive.
